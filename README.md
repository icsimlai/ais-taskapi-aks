# Azure DevOps and AKS Features Demonstration
This is the readme document for Azure DevOps and AKS Features Demonstration. There are a couple of modules under this series of demo  which show how to create a Azure DevOps Project and explore various features in the AKS Cluster. The demonstration is going to be done in the same AKS Cluster that is built by of Azure DevOps module("aisazdevops-taskapi").Use a Azure DevOps Project to provision all the Azure resources, a Git code repository, Application Insights integration and a CI/CD pipeline setup for deployment to AKS. Use the DevOps Project dashboard to monitor code commits, builds and deployments from a single view in the Azure portal. The demo uses a C#/.NET Core application in Azure DevOps Project to target AKS and show how the DevOps project creates an AKS cluster along with an Azure Container Registry (ACR) and configures a trust relationship between the two. This enables AKS cluster to pull down container images from ACR. The Build and Release pipeline in VSTS builds the Docker container image, pushes the image to ACR then packaged the Helm chart and deploys it to the newly created AKS cluster.
